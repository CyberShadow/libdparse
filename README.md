libdparse
=========

Library for lexing and parsing D source code

# Documentation
The code itself is reasonably well documented. Uploading HTML browsable
documentation is on the TODO list.

# Testing
Tests are present in the test directory. To run them execute the run\_tests.sh
script. Running the tests on Windows is not currently supported.
